# Weather-Dashboard
Weather Dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Guide
The program allows users to enter a city name and search for the current forecast and also the next five days for that city. Unique city names are stored in the users local storage and rendered as input fields that the user can click on to search via their search history. The page background also changes dynamically based on the city the user has searched for. This application uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and two third party API's: "Open Weather Api" for the weather data and "Unsplashed" for the background images.

## Demo
This is what the application looks like when the user has already searched up a few cities:
